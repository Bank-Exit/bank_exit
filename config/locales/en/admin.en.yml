          Merchant's address: leave empty or vague to protect their anonymity.

          Note: this field is not linked to the delivery zone and is only displayed on the directory listing.

        new_coin_wallet: New crypto wallet
        coin_wallet_body_help: |
          Select the cryptocurrency or cryptocurrencies accepted by this merchant.

          If a public address is provided, a QR code will be shown to users so they can scan and send money directly. Otherwise, only the cryptocurrency icon will be displayed.

        new_delivery_zone: New delivery zone
        delivery_zone_body_help: |
          The Nominatim API will be called for entries of type "city" or "department" to retrieve applicable geolocation data, with the goal of enabling nested ("Russian doll") filtering. For example, a delivery zone set to the country "France" should match a user search for the region "Corsica", the department "Cher", or the city of "Strasbourg". ISO codes are used for this.

          Note: since "region" entries are currently limited to France, unnecessary geocoder calls are avoided by forcing the value.

          Note: processing may take a few seconds to complete depending on the number of zones to analyze.

        merchant_disabled_body_html: |
          Merchants labeled as <span class="badge badge-sm badge-error">Disabled</span> were not included in the results during the latest API refresh with Overpass. This may mean the merchant has closed, no longer accepts cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Monero, or June), or that someone vandalized the data on OpenStreetMap.

          It is therefore up to the Collective to review these changes and confirm whether the merchant should be removed from the map or reactivated (by default, the merchant is marked as "soft deleted," which means they remain in the database but are no longer visible on the map or in search results).

          Note that if the merchant is confirmed as legitimate and reactivated on Bank-Exit, they will become <span class="badge badge-sm badge-error">Disabled</span> again at each data refresh as long as the source hasn't been corrected on OSM, since the algorithm considers OSM to be the source of truth.
