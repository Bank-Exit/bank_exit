00:04.880 --> 00:08.220
And so here I am, finally arrived in the

00:08.220 --> 00:11.040
French countryside — the real one — where people

00:11.040 --> 00:12.599
grow beautiful things,

00:12.599 --> 00:14.700
vegetables, fruits… and so I’m here with

00:14.700 --> 00:16.740
Camille, who produces vegetables and

00:16.740 --> 00:18.359
fruits, and I’ll be able to buy from him

00:18.359 --> 00:21.000
for the first time a basket of

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
vegetables using Bitcoin or Monero — and

00:24.000 --> 00:25.439
today we’ll go with Monero.

00:25.439 --> 00:28.260
We’re in the field — he prefers to

00:28.260 --> 00:30.300
remain anonymous, but as you can see,

00:30.300 --> 00:31.820
we’ve got a wonderful

00:31.820 --> 00:34.040
plot of land here.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.920
So today — broccoli, right — I’ve weighed everything.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.020
Perfect. Broccoli, carrots,

00:42.020 --> 00:46.160
butternut squash, a bunch of radishes, etc.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.120
So you can take a look.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.079
Perfect. It’s possible to pay me in

00:52.079 --> 00:54.539
crypto, even here in the countryside. We’ve only got

00:54.539 --> 00:56.340
3G, no 5G antenna — you can

00:56.340 --> 00:59.039
look around, you can see it here.

00:59.039 --> 01:01.020
So the total is €16, right? About

01:01.020 --> 01:04.100
€16.22, okay.

01:04.100 --> 01:07.020
I’m using the CakeWallet app — you too,

01:07.020 --> 01:08.460
I think? I only need one

01:08.460 --> 01:10.799
hand. I hold the crate with my left

01:10.799 --> 01:12.240
hand and pay with my right.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.680
I’ve got a bit of money on it —

01:13.680 --> 01:16.439
around $56 — well, €56,

01:16.439 --> 01:19.860
let’s say. I tap “Send” — I don’t know

01:19.860 --> 01:22.140
if you can see clearly — and then I type

01:22.140 --> 01:25.320
“16” “22”. It’s in dollars, but let’s say

01:25.320 --> 01:28.100
it’s about the same.

01:28.259 --> 01:30.540
And then I scan

01:30.540 --> 01:32.780
your wallet address

01:32.780 --> 01:36.540
with my phone. Perfect, I scan that.

01:36.540 --> 01:39.500
I enlarge my QR code.

01:39.960 --> 01:42.900
Here we go — perfect.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.420
It’s arrived — so the address is on top and

01:45.420 --> 01:48.780
the amount — that’s 0.1 Monero — and

01:48.780 --> 01:52.380
I hit “Send.”

01:52.619 --> 01:55.220
It’s loading...

01:56.640 --> 01:58.740
Okay. So now I paid less than one cent

01:58.740 --> 02:00.840
in fees for this basket. It’s still

02:00.840 --> 02:02.520
less than what you’d usually pay to

02:02.520 --> 02:04.860
Visa or Mastercard.

02:04.860 --> 02:07.399
And that’s it!

02:10.259 --> 02:12.260
And now, if we go into the

02:12.260 --> 02:17.340
transactions — there it is, I’ve already received it.

02:17.340 --> 02:20.400
0.1 Monero — and now we’ll wait… either we

02:20.400 --> 02:22.080
stop here, or we wait a few

02:22.080 --> 02:24.300
moments for it to be confirmed by the

02:24.300 --> 02:27.720
global Monero network. Anyway, thank you

02:27.720 --> 02:29.520
Camille, that’s perfect — I’ll take my

02:29.520 --> 02:32.520
basket. Thanks to the global

02:32.520 --> 02:34.680
Monero system, thanks to Camille — I’ll be able

02:34.680 --> 02:37.379
to head home with all this, and as you can see,

02:37.379 --> 02:39.780
it was pretty simple — and anywhere in

02:39.780 --> 02:41.940
France it works with just an

02:41.940 --> 02:45.980
app — so why not give it a try?
