- question: What is the difference between the map and the directory?
  content:
    - answer:
        - The map lists merchants with precise geolocation (latitude and longitude).
        - The directory lists businesses that don't have a specific address, either because they want to remain anonymous or because the service is available for delivery to an entire area or country. For example, an alternative media outlet or an online business.
