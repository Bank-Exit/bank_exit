      body:
        - It is possible to export the merchants displayed on the map and import them into a mapping application such as <a href="https://www.comaps.app" target="_blank">CoMaps</a>, which works even without an internet connection.
        - This tutorial walks you through the steps so you can access merchant data anytime—whether you're traveling, on a train, or offline.

    - body:
        - Select your search filters on the map page or leave them as default to export all merchants. In this example, we’ll use Monero merchants located in France. Open the menu by clicking the three vertical dots and download by clicking on <strong>Download merchants</strong>.

        - On the map view, tap the <strong>star icon</strong> in the bottom menu to access the <strong>Bookmarks and Tracks</strong> screen.

          klass: "lg:w-1/2"

    - body:
        - Navigate to the <strong>.gpx</strong> file you just downloaded (usually located in your device’s <strong>Downloads</strong> folder) and select it. This will start the import process.

    - mode: info
      body:
        - "Note: Depending on the number of merchants in the file, the import process may take more or less time."

    - body:
        - Once imported, the merchants will appear on the map. You can now view or edit them for offline navigation.

          klass: "lg:w-1/2"

    - body:
        - To hide the newly imported merchants, tap the <strong>star icon</strong> again at the bottom of the map and uncheck the small green eye next to the import entry. Tap the eye again to make them reappear.

      body:
        - "Note: There is no automatic synchronization, so you’ll need to download merchants and import then again into CoMaps to update the data."

    Tutorial for registering and configuring the Nostr social network
    to replace Twitter
  content:
    - mode: info
      body:
        - <abbr title="Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays">Nostr</abbr> is a decentralised network protocol that serves as a distributed social network. Anyone can run their own relay (server) and thus avoid censorship due to the redundancy of messages published.
        - In this tutorial, we'll be using the <strong>Snort</strong> client, but the process is similar for most Nostr sites and applications. Note that once your account has been created with Snort, you can change applications or sites at your convenience by reimporting your account using the private key that will be generated for you.

    - body:
        - Go to https://snort.social and click on "Register".
        - From there, the registration process begins, with several steps detailed below.
      figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/1_home.jpg

    - body:
        - Choose a pseudonym.
      figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/2_create_account.jpg

    - body:
        - Choose an avatar.
      figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/3_choose_picture.jpg

    - body:
        - Choose your areas of interest.
      figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/4_select_interests.jpg

    - body:
        - Choose Nostr contacts to follow.
      figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/5_follow_friends.jpg

    - body:
        - Choose the options that allow you to hide certain content from your feed (porn, politics, etc.).
        - Once validated, registration will be finalised but you will still be able to modify your information afterwards.

    - mode: success
      body:
        - You'll notice that at no point does the site ask for your email or telephone number. That's because Nostr is cryptographically based and doesn't need any personal information from you. Your account belongs entirely to you!

    - figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/6_clean_feed.jpg

    - body:
        - "Congratulations \U0001F389 ! You're now on the home page of your Nostr feed!"
        - You can start searching for content by clicking on "Search" in the menu.
      figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/7_search_content.jpg

    - body:
        - You can now follow any profile by clicking on the "Follow" button.
      figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/8_follow_profiles.jpg

    - body:
        - Now it's time to make a backup of your private key. To do this, click on "Export keys" in the settings.

    - mode: warning
      body:
        - It is very important to note down your private key and/or your mnemonic phrase. This is the only way to restore your account. If you lose them, you will no longer be able to access your messages and contacts on Nostr.
        - Do not share the private key with anybody.

        - image: tutorials/social_network/10_export_keys.jpg

    - body:
        - You can edit your profile at any time to change your photo or description
      figure:
        - image: tutorials/social_network/11_edit_your_profile.jpg

    - body:
        - Now it's time to publish your first message. To do this, click on the "New post" button at the bottom left and enter your content in the popup that opens.

    - mode: info
      body:
        - From now on, you should assume that any content published on a Nostr relay will remain there. Even if the delete function exists, there is no guarantee that the relays will honour this request. What's more, as a message can be republished on any relay, it becomes more complicated to know where the message is. This is another of Nostr's strengths.
